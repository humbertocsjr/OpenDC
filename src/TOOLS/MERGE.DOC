       merge is a program used to merge a C source file with its
       corresponding assembly language file generated by the
       DeSmet C compiler with the -A and -C switches.  The syntax
       for merge is:

           merge <file>

       where <file> is the name of the .C and .A files to be merged.
       The output of the merge program is placed in the file <file>.L
       For example, to get a merge listing of a file named BLIP, perform
       the following actions:

           c88 BLIP A C
           merge BLIP

       The file BLIP.L will be created with the merged information.
