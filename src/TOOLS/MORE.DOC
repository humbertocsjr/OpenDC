       more is a program used to view text files.  This version is
       slightly more sophisticated than the program which is delivered
       with PC-DOS.  It includes the ability to search for a given
       string.  The syntx for more is:

         more file ...

       where file may contain wildcard characters.


       when the program pauses and displays the --MORE-- prompt, you 
       have a number of choices:

          Q  terminates the program.

          / <pattern> searches for a line with the given pattern.
            if the pattern is not found, the --MORE-- prompt is 
            redisplayed.

          N finds the next line with the same pattern used in the last / 
            command.

          any other character will simply display the next 22 lines of 
          the file.
