       rm is a simple program to delete files.  The main difference
       between rm and DEL is that rm will accept multiple filenames and
       can work interactively.  The syntax for rm is:

          rm [-i ] [-l] filename ...

       where  filename may contain the wildcard characters * and ?

              -i sets the interactive mode.  rm will ask for 
                 confirmation on each of the files before deleting it.

              -l sets the list mode to list the names of the files as 
                 they are being deleted.

       if no filenames are given, the program will display its syntax 
       description.  (e.g.  if you only type rm  or if there are no
       files which match)

       rm does not support deletion of directories.
