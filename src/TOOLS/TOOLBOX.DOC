

	toolbox.s : this is a library of useful routines as described below

---------------
	int findfile(filename, target_buf) : searches for the file given in
		filename by checking the current directory and the directories
		listed in the PATH environment variable.  If the file is found,
		findfile returns 1 and the target_buf area contains the FULL
		pathname.  If the file isn't found, 0 is returned.

		Requirements:
			This routine uses 300 bytes of stack.

		Limits:
			only 256 bytes of the PATH variable will be searched.

		System: 
			MS-DOS 2.0

---------------
	int environ(search_string, target, max) : searches the environment for
		the variable name which corresponds to search_string.  If found,
		the target area will be filled with at most max characters from
		the variable string and the length of the string will be returned.
		If the search_string is not found, -1 is returned.

		Requirements:
			none

		Limits:
			none

		System:
			MS-DOS 2.0


---------------
	Line input routines:

	char *cur_line;
	int  line_number;

	line_start(fname, position, first_line) : opens the file fname at
		at the location position (long).  The first line of the file
		will be pointed to by cur_line after this call and line_number
		will be first_line. Returns 1 if successful, 0 otherwise.

	line_next() : returns 1 if another line is available, sets cur_line
		to point at the new line and increments line_number.  returns
		0 if no more lines are available.

	line_stop() : closes the input file.

		Requirements:
			1300 bytes of data
		
		Limits:
			255 maximum line length

		System:
			MS-DOS 1.1 or 2.0

	line2_start, line2_next, line2_stop, cur2_line, line2_number: same
		as above for a second file.
---------------
	main(argc, argv) : this is a C main procedure which expands wildcard
		filenames out to multiple arguments.  Command line items such
		as *.c return all the .c files in the current directory.
		The user main program must be named main1 instead of main for
		the linkage to work.

		Requirements:
			This routine uses 4096 bytes of stack.

		Limits:
			4096 bytes of pointer array and data.

		System: 
			MS-DOS 2.0,2.1
