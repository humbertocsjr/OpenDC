       grep is a program used to search files for lines containing a 
       certain pattern.  Whenever the pattern is found, the line is 
       listed on the screen.  The syntax for grep is:

          grep [ -y ] <search pattern> file ...

       where  -y indicates that case is to be ignored during the search.
        
              <search pattern> is any sequence of characters.  It may 
              contain the wildcard characters * and ?.  NOTE: if the 
              pattern contains blanks or wildcard characters, then the 
              search pattern must be enclosed with double quotes (").

              file is any filename and may contain wildcard characters.

       When a match is found, grep will display the line along with the 
       line number a filename.
