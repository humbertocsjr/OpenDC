      ls is a directory listing program loosely based on the UNIX utility.  
      It features multiple-column listing, sort by name or modification 
      date and reverse order sorting.  The syntax for running ls is:

        ls [ -ltr1? ] [ pathname ... ]

      where pathname can be a drive name ( C: ), a directory name, or a 
            filename which may contain the wildcard search characters *
            and ?.  If no pathname is given, the current directory is 
            assumed.

			-l invokes the long format which is a single column listing
               with the following format:

               <name>        <attrib>        <size>     <time>    <date>

               <attrib> has three fields.  The first field displays the 
               type of file ( - is for normal files, s is for system 
               files, d is for directories and h is for hidden files).  
               The second field indicates read permission which always 
               happens to be on (r).  The third field indicates write 
               permission is w if the file is writable or - if not.

            -t changes the sort order to list files by their 
               modification dates rather the default alphabetical order.  
               Times are listed with the most recently modified files 
               first.  

            -r reverses the order of the sort, alphabetic or by time.

            -1 produces a single column of output.

            -? displays the input syntax for ls.


      At the end of the listing, the number of files listed and the 
      total size of the listed files is displayed.
