	This is a simple program to make character output to the screen run 
	faster than the standard IBM-PC BIOS routines.  It works by 
	intercepting the level 16 interrupts (int 10H) and routing the 
	character output(write tty) requests to code which acts directly on
	the screen buffer.  Requests which are not supported are passed on
	to the normal BIOS routine.

    Works for all programs which use the BIOS calls or DOS calls.


    To install the program, simply run

      fastscr
